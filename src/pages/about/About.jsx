                    Hi there! My name is Andrii Sakhno and I am a web developer. I have a passion for technology and enjoy creating dynamic and functional websites. <br/><br/>
                    This blog is a platform for me to share my experiences and journey in the world of web development. I am currently a student at the National Transport University,
                    where I am learning about the latest trends and techniques in web development. <br/><br/>
                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new places,
                    trying new foods, and spending time with friends and family. I hope you enjoy reading my blog and join me on my journey as a web developer.
